# Learning-5-Langs

Here i'll update 5 different projects
Each day of the week for 2 months i'll be working on a different project to learn 5 different programming laguages
If i feel like working on the weekends i'll pick one of them and give it some attention

I'll be updating my experience here too

Mon 1. JavaScript/HTML: Task Manager (To-Do List App)
Difficulty: Beginner
This project is a great starting point because it focuses on client-side development, which involves basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You'll practice DOM manipulation and event handling without dealing with backend or complex data structures.

Tue 2. Python: Web Scraper with Data Analysis
Difficulty: Beginner-Intermediate
Web scraping is a good next step because it introduces HTTP requests and data handling. Using libraries like BeautifulSoup or pandas will allow you to manipulate and analyze data. Python's ease of use makes this a manageable project for a beginner moving into intermediate territory.

Wed 3. Go: URL Shortener
Difficulty: Intermediate
Go has a simple syntax but introduces you to concepts like HTTP servers, routing, and possibly working with databases. The URL shortener will get you familiar with Go’s concurrency and lightweight performance for handling multiple requests.

Thu 4. Rust: Command-Line File Organizer
Difficulty: Intermediate-Advanced
While this project doesn’t involve web development, it introduces the complexity of Rust's memory safety and ownership model. Writing efficient and safe file system manipulation code is a bit challenging, especially in Rust. You'll also dive into creating command-line interfaces.

Fri 5. Java with Angular: Full-Stack E-commerce App
Difficulty: Advanced
This project is the most complex as it combines front-end (Angular) and back-end (Java with Spring Boot) development. You’ll need to handle client-server interactions, REST APIs, databases, and possibly authentication. Managing state and data flow between the frontend and backend adds additional complexity.

Update 1# 15/oct/2024 
  
  My experience is limited to have done some scripts with AutoHotKey, some automations with Powershell (mainly Active Directory and Exchange integrations, but some UI too) and lastly my very first experience was with HTML when i was 12. I'd make very visualy simple websites line by line using a small book i had with every step on how to create websites. The CSS part i never fully understood at the time. Recently i've taken some lession with Alura about HTML, CSS and JS. My last personal project was setting up a Wiki so i been introduced to SQL too. 
  Before i dropped my first Associates Degree (IT management) i was introduced to programming logic and object oriented programming too.
  Well i already started the HTML + JS project back in another PC but i can't retrieve it. So next week i'll start over
  I'll be using help from ChatGPT and Google Gemini to ask questions and learn about the languages since it would be a waste to not take advantage of amazing tools like them. Also i'll be taking care to not let them give me full codes that i simply paste onto my projects without fully knowing how it functions. My objective is to be able to do everything by hand and from scratch if needed.
